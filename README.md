# Ignition-Hacks-Delta
# Book Suggester 2000

My project for the Ignition Hacks Hackathon is to create Nova, The Book Suggester. Nova is a machine learning bot that will give you suggestions and recommendations to books.

Nova is a self-learning book recommender. She only picks books that interest the user by their previous history of borrowed books, it learned by herself and she can properly assign recommendations to the right person.

The way Nova works is that a user can type in their full name, then, if you don't already have an account, you can create a new one. Once you are logged in, you can borrow any book in the library. After you've read it and returned it back, it will appear in your history. Nova will recommend books based on your previous book theme history as well as give some randomly generated books for you to try. Some big achievements we have made are making sure the randomly generated book does not appear twice with the theme recommendations, the fact that Nova can keep track of your borrow history and recommend similar books to the original one is a great acheivment.

Now to talk about the code. The coding has properly organized functions and modules to use in the main script. The comments are easy to understand and related to the lines after the comment. All the code is organized and the names of the created variables are related to what we are trying to accomplish. In all, the code is nice and organized, easy to understand and the comments are easily understood.

My overall scope of this project is to make a good, well-rounded robot that can help children with book recommendations.
